# HealthMetrics_IMC_IDR
 This repository contains a project that implements the calculation of Body Mass Index (BMI) and Relative Development Index (RDI). The goal of the project is to provide a simple and efficient tool for calculating BMI based on weight and height, as well as evaluating the RDI, which can be used to measure relative development in different contexts (e.g., childhood growth, athletes, etc.).
